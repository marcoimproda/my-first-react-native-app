# my-first-react-native-app
[Expo]: https://expo.io/
This is my first approach to React Native. I have installed and tried [Expo] to testing the result on my Android Device.
It's very simple and stupid. Input your name and the app display it. That's it. Just a Hello World with user interaction :)

# Testing

I don't expect anyone to compile & build this "hello-world". But if you'd like...

### `npm install & npm start`
